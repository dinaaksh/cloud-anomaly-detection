# cloud-anomaly-detection
This project focuses on Azure cloud and has the potential to be used in other cloud services but due to a lack of access credentials we could not work on other providers(AWS,Oracle,..)
It is a WIP for integrating other service providers as well.
The model.ipynb file contains the SVM model made on the dataset of azure cloud logs.
Azure API is accessed to login the customer into the client.
Groq API is used for LLM used in the autogenerated emails for each anomaly.
The prototype.mp4 file is a demo of the model.
